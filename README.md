I am thrilled to share the outcome of my internship project at CodSoft, where I had the opportunity to work on developing a To-Do List Application using Tkinter and customtkinter in Python. Throughout this project, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned how to create user-friendly desktop applications with an intuitive interface.

üìú Project Overview:
The To-Do List app allows users to easily add, remove, update, and manage tasks. The application features:

A dynamic list box to display tasks.
Buttons for task management like Add, Remove, and Update tasks.
Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in a text file to maintain state across app sessions.
A sidebar with a profile section and navigation links.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
Python (Tkinter & customtkinter)
File Handling for saving and loading tasks.
GUI Design: Developed with a clean and user-friendly interface.
This project provided an excellent opportunity to practice Python programming, enhance my problem-solving skills, and understand the importance of user-centric design.
A big thank you to Divakar Kushwaha Sir for his valuable guidance and support throughout the development process. Your mentorship helped me refine my skills and approach problems efficiently!

ü§ù Grateful for the Opportunity:
This internship with CodSoft allowed me to dive deep into desktop application development and GUI design while working on a project that I‚Äôm truly proud of. The experience I‚Äôve gained has not only improved my coding skills but also expanded my understanding of how software development can solve real-world problems.
Looking forward to more learning and growth in my journey ahead!
